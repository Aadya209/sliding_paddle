🎮 Sliding Paddle Game

A browser-based paddle game where you play against an AI opponent! The challenge increases as you score points and progress through levels. Can you beat the AI before the difficulty maxes out?

🕹️ Gameplay

* Use the mouse or arrow keys (↑ / ↓) to move your paddle (left side).
* The AI controls the paddle on the right.
* Bounce the ball back and try not to miss!
* Every time you survive a round or the AI misses, you level up.
* The game gets faster and harder with each level.
* Reach Level 5 to win — miss once, and it's game over!
